Unzip file

Copy the plugin folder to:
`site/plugins/nomad-kirby-comments`

## Panel: Article blueprint
Add the comments field and the hidden pending flag to your **article blueprint** (`site/blueprints/pages/article.yml`):

```yaml
comments:
  extends: fields/comments
```

> `hasPendingComments` is automatically maintained by the plugin and is used for the pending-only inbox filter.

## Panel: Pending-only inbox (Site tab)
Add this tab to your `site/blueprints/site.yml`:

```yaml
tabs:
  comments:
    label: Pending Comments
    icon: chat
    sections:
      pendingComments:
        type: pages
        headline: Pending Comments
        layout: table
        query: site.index.filterBy("intendedTemplate","article").filterBy("comments","*=","pending")
        info: "{{ page.pendingCommentsCount }} pending · {{ page.approvedCommentsCount }} approved"
        limit: 50
        create: false
        sortable: false
        duplicate: false
        status: false

```

## Frontend: Show comments + form
In your article template:

```php
<?php snippet('comments') ?>
```

Only **approved** comments display publicly; new submissions are saved as **pending**.

## Frontend: Show counts on lists
In your blog/home list loop:

```php
<?php snippet('comment-meta', ['page' => $article]) ?>
```

## Email notifications (optional)
In `site/config/config.php`:

```php
return [
  'nomad.kirby.comments.notify' => true,
  'nomad.kirby.comments.email'  => 'you@example.com',
];
```

## Storage
Comments are stored in the article content file as a YAML structure field.
